# Open OnDemand on AWS with Parallel Cluster

This reference architecture provides a set of templates for deploying [Open OnDemand (OOD)](https://openondemand.org/) with [AWS CloudFormation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/) and integration points for [AWS Parallel Cluster](https://aws.amazon.com/hpc/parallelcluster/).

The main branch is for Open OnDemand v 3.1.1

## Architecture

![architecture](images/architecture.png)

The primary components of the solution are:

1. Application load balancer as the entry point to your OOD portal.
1. An Auto Scaling Group for the OOD Portal.
1. A Microsoft ManagedAD Directory
1. A Network Load Balancer (NLB) to provide a single point of connectivity to Microsoft ManagedAD
1. An Elastic File System (EFS) share for user home directories
1. An Aurora MySQL database to store Slurm Accounting data
1. Automation via Event Bridge to automatically register and deregister Parallel Cluster HPC Clusters with OOD

## Prerequisites

This solution was tested with PCluster version 3.10.1 

## Deployment ðŸš€

### All-in-one Deployment

All in one deployment including **infrastructure** and **Open OnDemand**

1. Run [deploy-assets.sh](deploy-assets.sh) to deploy the CloudFormation assets to an S3 bucket in the respective AWS account
2. Deploy all-in-one stack [ood_full.yml](assets/cloudformation/ood_full.yml)

**Note**: `DeploymentAssetBucketName` is the output from step 1 (deploy assets)

### Individual Component Deployment

**Deploy Stacks individually:**

1. Deploy Infrastructure (*Networking, and Managed Active Directory*): [infra.yml](assets/cloudformation/infra.yml)
2. Deploy Open OnDemand: [ood.yml](assets/cloudformation/ood.yml)

### Post Deployment Steps

Once deployed, you should be able to navigate to the URL you set up as a CloudFormation parameter and log into your Open OnDemand portal. You can use the username `Admin` and retrieve the default password from Secrets Manager. The correct secret can be identified in the output of the Open OnDemand CloudFormation template via the entry with the key `ADAdministratorSecretArn`.

### Deploying an integrated Parallel Cluster HPC Cluster

The OOD solution is built so that a Parallel Cluster HPC Cluster can be created and automatically registered with the portal.

In your Parallel Cluster config, you must set the following values:

1. HeadNode:
    1. SubnetId: PrivateSubnet1 from OOD Stack Output
    1. AdditionalScurityGroups: HeadNodeSecurityGroup from CloudFormation Outputs
    1. AdditionalIAMPolicies: HeadNodeIAMPolicyArn from CloudFormation Outputs
    1. OnNodeConfigured
        1. Script: CloudFormation Output for the ClusterConfigBucket; in the format `s3://$ClusterConfigBucket/pcluster_head_node.sh`
        1. Args: Open OnDemand CloudFormation stack name
1. SlurmQueues:
    1. SubnetId: PrivateSubnet1 from OOD Stack Output
    1. AdditionalScurityGroups: ComputeNodeSecurityGroup from CloudFormation Outputs
    1. AdditionalIAMPolicies: ComputeNodeIAMPolicyArn from CloudFormation Outputs
    1. OnNodeConfigured
        1. Script: CloudFormation Output for the ClusterConfigBucket; in the format `s3://$ClusterConfigBucket/pcluster_worker_node.sh`
        1. Args: Open OnDemand CloudFormation stack name

**Note:** A sample pcluster configuration can be created using [scripts/create_sample_pcluster_config.sh](scripts/create_sample_pcluster_config.sh)

#### Optional - Enable pam_slurm_adopt module for Parallel Cluster compute nodes

The [pam_slurm_adopt](https://slurm.schedmd.com/pam_slurm_adopt.html) module can be enabled on Compute nodes in ParallelCluster to prevent users from ssh'ing to nodes they do not have a job running.

In your Parallel Cluster config, update the following configuration(s):

1/ Check if any steps have been launched.

Add the **CustomSlurmSetting** `PrologFlags: "contain"` in the [Scheduling](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/parallelcluster/latest/ug/Scheduling-v3.html) section.  Refer to [slurm configuration](https://slurm.schedmd.com/pam_slurm_adopt.html#important) documentation for more details on this slurm setting.

*example*
```
  SlurmSettings:  
    CustomSlurmSettings:
      - PrologFlags: "contain"
```

2/ Ensure compute nodes are exclusively allocated to users.  

Add the **CustomSlurmSetting** `ExclusiveUser: "YES"` in the [SlurmQueues](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/parallelcluster/latest/ug/Scheduling-v3.html#Scheduling-v3-SlurmQueues) section.  Refer to [slurm partition configuration](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html#OPT_ExclusiveUser) for more details.

*example*
```
  CustomSlurmSettings:
    ExclusiveUser: "YES"
```

3/ Add [configure_pam_slurm_adopt.sh](scripts/configure_pam_slurm_adopt.sh) to **OnNodeConfigured** in the [CustomActions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/parallelcluster/latest/ug/Scheduling-v3.html#Scheduling-v3-SlurmQueues-CustomActions) section.  

*example*
```
    CustomActions:
      OnNodeConfigured:
        Sequence:
        - Script: s3://$ClusterConfigBucket/pcluster_worker_node.sh
            Args:
            - Open OnDemand CloudFormation stack name
        - Script: s3://$ClusterConfigBucket/configure_pam_slurm_adopt.sh
```

### Integration with Parallel Cluster Login Node

When [ParallelCluster Login Nodes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/parallelcluster/latest/ug/login-nodes-v3.html) are used a **post-deployment** script is required to enable shell access in Open OnDemand.
Follow the below steps to configure the Login Node post-deployment:

Replace the following values:
- `<OOD_STACK_NAME>` - name of the Open OnDemand stack name found in CloudFormation
- `<ClusterConfigBucket>` - 'ClusterConfigBucket' Output found in the Open OnDemand stack

```bash
S3_CONFIG_BUCKET=<ClusterConfigBucket>
aws s3 cp s3://$S3_CONFIG_BUCKET/configure_login_nodes.sh .
chmod +x configure_login_nodes.sh
./configure_login_nodes.sh <OOD_STACK_NAME>
```

### Enabling Interactive Desktops

You can enable interactive clusters on the Portal server by following the directions [here](https://osc.github.io/ood-documentation/latest/enable-desktops/add-cluster.html).

In addition to the above steps, you must update `/etc/resolv.conf` on the Portal instance to include the Parallel Cluster Domain (`ClusterName.pcluster`) in the search configuration. `resolv.conf` will look similar to the example below. The cluster name, in this case was `democluster`.

Example resolv.confg:
```
# Generated by NetworkManager
search ec2.internal democluster.pcluster
nameserver 10.0.0.2
```

This requires you to have a compute queue with `pcluster_worker_node_desktop.sh` as your `OnNodeConfigured` script.

## RHEL9 support

RHEL9 has been added as another deployment option.  To deploy use the [rhel9-support](https://github.com/aws-samples/open-on-demand-on-aws/tree/rhel9-support) branch for deployment.

## Troubleshooting

### Issue submitting jobs after adding a ParallelCluster

There can be errors submitting jobs after integrating OOD w/ParalleCluster due to slurm registering the cluster.  Review the logs found in `/var/log/sbatch.log` and check if there are errors related to available clusters.

*sample log entry*
```
vbatch: error: No cluster 'sandbox-cluster' known by database.
sbatch: error: 'sandbox-cluster' can't be reached now, or it is an invalid entry for --cluster.  Use 'sacctmgr list clusters' to see available clusters.
```

If this occurs, restart both the `slurmctld` and `slurmdbd` services should be restarted. 

```bash
systemctl restart slurmctld
systemctl restart slurmdbd
```

Once restarted check the available clusters to verify the cluster is listed.

```bash
sacctmgr list clusters
```
